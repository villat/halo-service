## Implemented Functions

### 1) Endpoint to assign an User from Cognito the SUPER_ADMIN Role

It's a POST method which needs an **Authorization** header containing the JWT generated by Cognito.

### 2) Endpoint to create a new Owner (company admin) user.

It's a POST method which needs an **Authorization** header from a SUPER_ADMIN user.

Example body:

```json
{
    "username": "test",
    "email": "test@gmail.com",
    "password": "Somepassword!"
}
```
The password must contain a lower case letter, an upper case letter, a special character, a number, and be at least 8 characters long. Also, it's only a temporary password, when the Owner user logs in to Cognito for the first time, he'll need to change it.

### 3) Endpoint to create a new Company.

It's a POST method which needs an **Authorization** header from a OWNER user. (This is only for demo purposes, the actual implementation will allow SUPER_ADMIN users to create companies as well)

Example body:

```json
{
    "name": "Dunder Mifflin",
    "type": "Paper"
}
```
